# BT-AML Dashboard
At the Hacking Big Numbers 2 event hosted by Veridion, my team and I developed a project based on the theme of Anti-Money-Laundering, offered by Banca Transilvania. I took on the responsibility of creating the dashboard and adapting it to the AI model.

Within the challenging 48-hour timeframe, I successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive application dashboard. This dashboard featured functionalities for file uploads and detailed statistics, all wrapped up in a sleek, user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrated with our backend. I'm excited to share this blend of functionality and design excellence, showcasing our solution's capabilities.
